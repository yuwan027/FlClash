# restls-client-go

This is the core client side library that powers the [restls](https://github.com/3andne/restls) protocol. It is based on the refraction-networking/utls and has been modified to provide ClientHello fingerprinting resistance for Restls.
It is able to parrot four types of TLS clients: 
* `ios`
* `chrome`
* `safari`
* `firefox`
